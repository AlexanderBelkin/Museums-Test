# Museums-Test

Use English localization for the correct working of the app.
I test the app at Nexus 5x, Pixel 2 and it works well.
I had to wrap all work with date because we have different date types like: "ha", "h:mma", "hha", "hh:mma". So you can check it in TimeMapper object.
The work with displaying address on the map was done with Geocoder API from default SDK.
